Oh, oh, oh
Out the gate like Messiah (like Messiah)
Crown around my head in barbed wire
They tried to exile with no trial
I'ma put my feet up on the fire (on the fire)
It's so wet, I put it on the dryer (dryer)
Hit her with the "you can't come, it's private"
I can't eat, I had to go on a diet (diet)
Can't you tell I keep it on a budget? (On a budget)
Beating myself up, I'm with the violence
In a tunnel, vision, I see no way out
And it's Disney Channel in the playhouse (playhouse)
I'll wake you up at the ending
It's true, you can never be this high (high)
There's no winner or losers in this fight
Everything you think of all time
I don't want your body, touch your mind (touch your mind)
They want to know how I am so trendy
33, they say I got too many
Be like me, let me know when you ready (when you ready)
Metal round my wrist, it's weighing heavy
Wanna be the hero of my story
Baby, if you let me be annoying (if you let me be)
Wanna wake up early in the morning
I just never wanted to be boring (it will never be)
Wanna be like me you can't afford it
Rainworld you will always be a tourist (you'll never be)
Never be like me, to be honest
They like how I'm steppin' with the Prada's (you can't walk like me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
