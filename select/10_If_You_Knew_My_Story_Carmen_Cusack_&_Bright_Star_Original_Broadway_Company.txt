If you knew my story you'd have a hard time
Believing me, you'd think I was lying
Joy and sorrow never last
I'll die trying not to live in the past
If you knew my story
My heaven and my hell
If you knew my story
You'd have a good story to tell
I left my clothes on that cold river rock
My cares and my woes rolled up in my socks
I lay down in that mountain stream
And the icy water rushed over me
If you knew my story
My heaven and my hell
If you knew my story
You'd have a good story to tell
Me I'm not alone
Tell me I'm not alone
Many backs have broken from lesser weight I know
I was born to carry more than I can hold
Even though I'll stumble
Even though I'll fall
You'll never see me crumble
You'll never see me crawl
If you knew my story
Drew water from the well
If you knew my story
You'd have a good story to tell
Me I'm not alone
Tell me I'm not alone
Even though I'll stumble
Even though I'll fall
You'll never see me crumble
You'll never see me crawl
If you knew my story
